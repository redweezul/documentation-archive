# EMAIL WORKFLOWS - Content Example

These are a pair of emails written to support a "reconfirmation" effort by PLK, an MSP. The process would request current subscribers confirm they want to continure receiving emails from us.

PLK divided active subscribers into two segments: Positive Approach and Negative Approach.
 
For the Positive Approach segment, the reconfirmation request would ask subscribers to take an action (fill out a short form) to confirm receiving emails. Anyone not doing so would be removed from the list.

For the Negative Approach segment, the reconfirmation request would tell subscribers they don't have to take an action to continue receiving emails. Anyone who didn't want to keep receiving emails could fill out a short form to request removal.

This is the email copy for both approaches.

## POSITIVE APPROACH COPY:

**[Subject Line] Still want to receive "WOOF - IT News You Can Use"? Please confirm (takes 10 seconds).**

The past 2 years have seen incredible changes...and we're not done yet!

We've seen sweeping changes to how businesses operate, find customers, and succeed. As such, we felt it was time to ask: Did you want to keep receiving "WOOF?"

You'll still get IT news you can use, each month, free. We may also start sending out Special Alerts - new cybersecurity risks to watch out for, deals on hardware, etc.

Sound good? Please confirm you want to stay on our mailing list with this simple form.

[FORM - INCLUDES NAME, EMAIL, COMPANY NAME]

If you don't want to receive WOOF any longer, you don't need to do anything. Within 7 days, we'll remove your email from our mailing list.

While we'd rather you stick around, we get buried in email too. Sometimes you need to purge even the good ones. If you change your mind, you can always resubscribe on PlanetMagpie.com. Take care!

### Results

PLK contacted a list of approximately 1,100 emails for reconfirmation, diving it in half between the Positive Approach copy and Negative Approach copy (approximately 550 emails each).

 - Open rate (Positive): 21.6%
 - Open rate (Negative): 28.5%
 - Unsubscribes (Positive, No Response/Submission): 9.7%
 - Unsubscribes (Negative, Active Form Submission): 2.4%

The results are clear. The Negative Approach had a better reception, and far fewer unsubscribes.

While content marketing often leans toward 'accentuating the positive' of a business' products/services, this example demonstrates that sometimes, taking a negative slant can work better.
